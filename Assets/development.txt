UPGRADE PROCESS
===============
upgrades
	-guns
		- faster firing
		- larger proximity
		- every x shot releases y
	-dome
		- repel
		- stronger shell
		- bird seed launcher (what is this? a distraction of some kind)
		- auto windscreen wiper

between waves you can...
	- clean poo with a rag (physically takes time)
	- repair cracks with some kind of glue-filler (physically takes time)
	- install an upgrade on your dome (mentally takes time)
...you have a limited time until the next wave comes

- upgrades are visually fantastic
- cleaning poo becomes a hassle the longer you leave (takes too long to clean off)
